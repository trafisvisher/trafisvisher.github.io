plaintext baby!

no need for any other editor... 

so ok here, a plan: 

tonight: lush and unreachable... no hardly unreachable, just sloppy 
(ha, thanks vs code for deeming 'unreachable' a term worthy of rememberance)

tomorrow = {
    morning: {
        exercise: "brisk-walk up aspen-glade north, 100 pushups (20x5)",
        food: "espresso(1)",
        task: "8 measures of a Bach Fugue"
    },
    afternoon: {
        exercise: "glute-activation",
        food: "eggs and greens",
        task: "ride to lavi/mariana/bella/brie and teach"
    },
    evening: {
        exercise: "riding home",
        food: "feta, greens, fish, olive oil, wine",
        task: "start composition of 'fantasy no 2'"
    }
 }
